Unikraft Summer of Code 2021 (USoC'21) finalizes with an 8 hour hackathon on Saturday, September 4, 2021, 9am CEST - 5pm CEST.

Teams of 3-4 participants will work on adding tests, adding metrics, port libraries, port applications and fix issues in Unikraft components.
Each hackathon challenge will get your team points, depending on the difficulty.
The top three teams will be awarded the most prestigious USoC badges:

* 3rd place: the [Green Dragon badge](https://eu.badgr.com/public/badges/WWBWO7ccTxmYLl7Om6o0Ig)
* 2nd place: the [Red Dragon badge](https://eu.badgr.com/public/badges/bTuLRsqzSKy8fZ5xrCyYSQ)
* 1st place: the [Black Dragon badge](https://eu.badgr.com/public/badges/hBNobLOGRJiydfzsibV2iw)

Challenges are listed below.
You solve a challenge:

* by submitting a pull request to the [corresponding Unikraft repository](https://github.com/unikraft/), or
* by creating a repository for a ported application / library

Points listed in challenges are a rough indication of difficulty.
It is possible to solve more than one challenge and earn all points from all challenges solved.

Additional points will be awarded for:

* Signing off your commits with `git commit -s`, as part of [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin) (1 point per commit) (note, teams of multiple people should have multiple sign-offs);
* Every commit should include a precise explanation of the changes made (1 point per commit);
* Every commit of the solution should leave the project in a working state (2 points per commit).

## Challenges

### 1. New `uktest` Suites, Cases & Expectations

| ID | Points | Short description |
|----|--------|-------------------|
| `uktest-entries` | 1 point per `*EXPECT*` | Use [uktest](/docs/sessions/06-testing-unikraft/#03-unikrafts-testing-framework.md) to add new tests in Unikraft components. |

#### Description

In this challenge, introduce new test suites, cases and assertions/expects in the Unikraft core repository.
New tests should be introduced as new files under a new directory `tests/` of internal microlibraries.
For example, for `vfscore`, a new directory will be located at `libs/vfscore/tests/`.

To create a suite, such as for `stat()` in `vfscore`, introduce a new file `test_stat.c` where you register the suite, cases and create expectations from the `stat()` syscall provided by `vfscore`.
Expectations and tests can usually be checked by programming different scenarios and checking whether the return code or `errno` is set correctly.
Check out the relevant POSIX document for the function in question.

Every new `*_EXPECT_*` test assertion will receive 1 point.
