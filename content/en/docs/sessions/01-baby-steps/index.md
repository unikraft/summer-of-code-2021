## Summary

## Practical Work

Describe summary of resources and tools used: repository, setup instructions.
Work items may be:

* **tutorials**: where all the instructions are given as a walkthrough for the participant
* **tasks**: where the support files (configuration files, source code files, solution skeleton files) are given and the goals are stated; the solution is to be developed by the participant

### 01. Work Item 1

Start with the goal of the work item.
Cleary tell what the aim is, such that the participant would know where to get at.

Continue by stating whether there are support files (i.e. a subfolder in the repository) or any resources are required.
If a tutorial, detail the instructions to reach the goal.
If a task, provide instructions and hints on reaching the goal.

Describe how the participant can validate reaching the goal, i.e. by getting an output message or by getting a certain behavior.
Provide snippets of running commands that show a successful solution.
